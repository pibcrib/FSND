## Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree (nd0044 v2)
This is the public repository for code I submitted to complete Udacity's Full-Stack Nanodegree program. Here, under the `projects` folder, you can find the the following projects I created throughout the duration of the course:

* *01_fyyur/starter_code* - This is the project from C1. SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
* *02_trivia_api/starter* - This is the project from C2. API Development and Documentation
* *03_coffee_shop_full_stack/starter_code* - This is the project from C3. Identity and Access Management
* *capstone* - This is the final project of this Nanodegree. The started code is included here, but the full project is listed in a separate repository. The project models the backen for a web application intended for use by a casting agency.

Feel free to suggest edits in the current repo by raising a PR.
